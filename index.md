# Project Name/Title Goes Here
I am working on a Gesture-Controlled Robot at Bluestamp. The robot is controlled by a glove on my hand, so when I move it, it goes a certain direction.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was completing the robot. I synced up the ESPs and added the accelerometer

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was making the robot. I made the car chassis and wired up the motors. Next, I coded the Arduino and made the blocks of code to move forward, backward, left, right, and to stop. I then replaced the arduino with an ESP because that is what will be receiving the input values from the other ESP in the finished product.  I had some trouble with the motor driver as it was not letting two wires into one output(I am doing a tank drive, so two motors per each side of the motor driver). For one output the screw was not going down. I was able to fix theses problems by using dupont wires which have more grip, so it wouldn't fall out while I was screwing them in and also didn't even need the screw to stay secure. I am hoping to make the glove and sync up the ESPs in the next milestone and hope to finish my modifications by my last milestone.
